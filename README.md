# Stray Light Correction Matrix
This repository contains the code, analysis, and supporting materials for the Stray Light Correction Project. The project aims to correct stray light effects in spectroradiometers using matrix-based correction methods. This work is inspired by the research paper “Simple spectral stray light correction method for array spectroradiometers” by Yuqin Zong et al.
